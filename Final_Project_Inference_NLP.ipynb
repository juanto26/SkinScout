    "Before we start loading the data, we must define the background and problem statement that can help us answer the problems in the data.

    "### i.1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The current skincare market is flooded with countless products each with unique ingredients and highlights. Consumers often struggle to decide which product most consumer recommend due to the large amount of reviews for each different products, making reading to all the review traditionally wasting too much time and effort. While other metrics such as star rating is present on most skincare website, relying on only star rating to rate the quality of a product is unreliable as research has shown that star rating has many problem such as negativity bias where one negative aspect could lead to users leading a low star despite excelling in other area and also sometime the review and star a user give has discreptancy with some research finding only a moderate correlation between review and star rating. Hence, consumers are left to go through multiple reviews in order to get an accurate insight regarding certain skincare product. Due to this factor our teams goal is to create an application where we could make this process easier by finding out whether a certain user will recommend or not recommend a product based on their review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### i.2. Problem Statement and Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create an application that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a recommender system in order to help predict whether a customer will recommend a product or not and also to give recommendation of similar skincare product. Our goal is to create a model with an accuracy of 80%. This is done by using model such as SVC and cosine similarity in order to create the model. By creating this model, our objective is to make the process of finding the perfect skincare product more time-efficient and less frustrating.\n",

I decided that since everyone was saying it was so good that I would try it. I bought the B-hydra intensive hydration serum. FIRST OF ALL: the price tag for this product was 50 dollars! Which in my opinion is a total rip- off. According to founder Tiffany Masterton, she said it was safe for all skin. She believes in the “ suspicious 6” which is totally not true. Coming from a woman who doesn’t even wash her face every day!! I used this and tested it on a small portion of my skin to make sure it was safe. I woke up to that part of skin inflamed and covered with bumps. I immediately returned the product and got my money back. This is a warning for everyone who is interested in buying drunk elephant. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!! Even if this product works well on your skin I think it is not work the price. I found the perfect dupe, ordinary B5 hyaluronic acid serum which is only 8 dollars and still delivers hydration to your face. In conclusion, this whole drunk elephant is a scam and is just a brand that was over hyped by popular influencers. I hope I saved you all from wasting your money!!! Happy shopping!!!\"}\n",
